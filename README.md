# Data engineering and analyzing with Apache Spark, Kafka, and Hadoop HDFS
This Spark-based code is run at the A-Fog (Analytics Fog) tier in our proposed multi-layer stream and big data analytics platform to catch carparks’ occupancies data streamed from multiple S-Fog systems, then store these data in the A-Fog’s HDFS for long-term data storage and large-scale data analytics later.
